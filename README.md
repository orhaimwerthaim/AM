Wrapping functional code models so they can be remotely called involves several techniques and approaches. Here are some of the most common methods:

### 1. **RESTful APIs**
   - **Description**: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are one of the most popular methods for wrapping functional code models. They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow remote interaction with the code.
   - **Tools**: Flask, Django (Python); Express.js (Node.js); Spring Boot (Java).
   - **Example**: Creating a REST API in Flask to expose model predictions.

### 2. **GraphQL APIs**
   - **Description**: GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It can be more efficient for complex queries.
   - **Tools**: Apollo Server (Node.js), Graphene (Python).
   - **Example**: Wrapping a data model with GraphQL using Apollo Server.

### 3. **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**
   - **Description**: RPC allows executing a subroutine or procedure in another address space. It is simpler than REST and often used for internal microservices communication.
   - **Protocols**: gRPC (Google's RPC framework), Thrift (Apache).
   - **Example**: Using gRPC to expose a model's inference function.

### 4. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**
   - **Description**: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML. It's more rigid and has built-in error handling.
   - **Tools**: Apache CXF, Spring WS.
   - **Example**: Implementing a SOAP web service with Spring WS.

### 5. **Serverless Functions**
   - **Description**: Serverless computing allows running code without managing the underlying infrastructure. Functions can be triggered by HTTP requests or other events.
   - **Providers**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions.
   - **Example**: Deploying a model inference function on AWS Lambda.

### 6. **Message Brokers and Queues**
   - **Description**: Asynchronous messaging systems can be used to send tasks to remote code models. These systems are useful for tasks that do not require an immediate response.
   - **Tools**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka.
   - **Example**: Using RabbitMQ to send image processing tasks to a remote model.

### 7. **Containers and Orchestration**
   - **Description**: Containerizing applications allows them to run in isolated environments, making deployment and scaling easier. Orchestration tools manage these containers.
   - **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes.
   - **Example**: Deploying a model wrapped in a Docker container, managed by Kubernetes.

### 8. **WebSockets**
   - **Description**: WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, useful for real-time applications.
   - **Tools**: Socket.io (Node.js), WebSocket API (Browser).
   - **Example**: Implementing a real-time chat application that uses a sentiment analysis model.

### 9. **API Gateways**
   - **Description**: API Gateways manage and route requests to various microservices, providing a single entry point.
   - **Tools**: AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee.
   - **Example**: Using AWS API Gateway to expose multiple models as RESTful services.

### 10. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**
   - **Description**: PaaS solutions provide a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
   - **Providers**: Heroku, Google App Engine.
   - **Example**: Deploying a web application with model APIs on Heroku.
